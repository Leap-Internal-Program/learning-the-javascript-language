# Learning the JavaScript Language

## Summary
 Joe Chellman explores the syntax behind the JavaScript language including variables, types, objects, arrays, operators, control structures, loops, and functions.

### Topics
- Using a text editor
- Declaring and assigning variables
- Booleans and the quest for truth
- Working with objects and arrays
- Using operators and control structures
- Iterating with loops
- Objects, references, and functions
- Promises, async, and await

## Estimated Time
The estimated time is more than 7.5 hours.
- Media 2h 53m.

## Directions
Code alongside Joe.  You may reference the exercise files to read his code.  Apprentices may recognize similar syntax between the C# language and JavaScript.  You may find it initially challenging to switch between writing code for two types of languages.

JavaScript also follows the naming convention for lowerCamelCase instead of PascalCase.  In lowerCamelCase, the first word is not capitalized and but indicates a following word with a single capitalized letter (e.g. singleCapitalizedLetter).

### Introduction
- Download the exercise files as directed by Joe.

### Getting Started
- Use an browser to follow along with the video.  You will notice all modern popular browsers for windows use chromium and share the same developer tools.

- Download and use Visual Studio Code to follow along with the video.

### Variable and Types

### Object, Arrays, and More
- JavaScript is considered a dynamically and weekly typed language.  C# is considered a statically and strongly typed language.  In JavaScript, you do not need indicate the type of your variable during declaration.

### Operators and Control Structure
- It is recommended to always use curly braces. 

### Iterating with Loops

### Functions
- ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes. JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.  Although many heavily use classes, Joe does not introduce classes here likely because classes are not compatible with EMCA ES5.

### More Advanced Pieces
- If you have additional time, write a call that starts the API you developed earlier in the week.
